<p>The Venerable
					Gyatrul Rinpoche was born in the Sichuan Province of China near the
					Tibetan border in 1925. At the age of seven, he was recognized as a "tulku"
					or a consciously reincarnated spiritual being, and was reinstated as Tulku
					of Dhomang Monastery. Rinpoche spent many years in retreat with some of
					Tibet's greatest Lamas and is a fully qualified teacher of Vajrayana
					Buddhism.</p>
<p class="topspace">In 1959, due to the Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet, Rinpoche fled his
					homeland and lived in India for twelve years. In 1972, he came to teach in
					America at the request of H.H. the Dalai Lama. In 1976, H.H. Dudjom
					Rinpoche appointed Gyatrul Rinpoche as his spiritual representative and
					Director of Pacific Region Yeshe Nyingpo.</p>
<p class="topspace">Rinpoche has established several
					centers on the West Coast and continues to travel and teach thousands of
					students abroad and in the United States. With his direct style,
					inimitable sense of humor and genuine humility, Rinpoche's teachings
					provide a bridge into the direct insights of practical Buddhism.</p>
