        Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rinpoche, or Precious Teacher, is considered to be a
        direct emanation of the Buddha. In the eighth century he took a crucial
        role in bringing Buddhism from India into Tibet. At that time King Trisong
        Deutsen of Tibet was encountering many obstacles in fulfilling his wish to
        establish Buddhism in his country. Hearing of the great spiritual power of
        the Indian master Padmasambhava, he invited him to Tibet, and there Guru
        Rinpoche subdued and transformed the harmful influences that were
        obstructing the flourishing of Buddhism. Thereafter, Guru Rinpoche and his
        main disciple and spiritual companion, Lady Yeshe Tsogyal, traveled
        throughout Tibet and taught the esoteric theories and practices of
        Vajrayana Buddhism, whereby one can attain enlightenment in one lifetime.
        This tradition of spiritual practice has been passed on in an unbroken
        lineage from realized teacher to disciple until the present day.
