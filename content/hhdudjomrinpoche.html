                His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche (1904-1987) was an incarnation of one of Guru Rinpoche's
                original twenty-five disciples and is considered one of the greatest
                Buddhist meditation masters, scholars, and poets of this century. His
                Holiness was the Supreme Head of the Nyingma Tradition of Tibetan
                Buddhism, which traces back to Padmasambhava. As the founder of numerous
                Yeshe Nyingpo meditation centers, his activities were extensive, bridging
                cultures and embodying centuries of wisdom. His Holiness was a prolific
                scholar and a Terton, or spiritual treasure revealer, responsible for
                bringing forth many prayers, unique for their potency and beauty, and
                particularly beneficial for our time. His reincarnation, born in 1991, has
                been formally recognized by the H. H. the Dalai Lama. The power of his
                aspiration is such that his emanations benefit beings whenever
                circumstances are right.
