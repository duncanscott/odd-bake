<h3 class="title">Lama Drimed Lodro</h3>
<p>
    Born in Tibet, Lama Drimed Lodro studied the Chinese language as a
    young boy. At the age of twelve, he asked his mother to leave home to
    study under the highly realized master, Galo Rinpoche.
    At the age of 15, Lama Drimed entered the renowned Sertha Larung
    Five Sciences Buddhist Academy and began 14 years of scholastic
    learning under H.H. Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche.  He continued his studies
    through the completion of all required training leading towards a
    Khenpo’s degree.

    From H.H. Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche, he received the
    entire Nyingtik lineage (Nyingtik Yabzhi, Dzod Dun, Ngalso
    Korsum, Yeshe Lama, and Chetzun Nyingtik) including empowerments, scriptural
    transmissions, and explanations on the pith instructions for the Great
    Perfection.  He also received the complete cycle of H.H. Jigme Phuntsok
    Rinpoche’s terma collection. From H.H. Penor Rinpoche, he received
    Nyingtik Yabzhi, Zhi Khro (A Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities),
    ‘Dus Pa Mdo (root tantra of Anuyoga), and many others cycles of
    profound teachings in the Palyul lineage. From Ven. Yangthang
    Rinpoche, he received the empowerments and scriptural
    transmissions for the Kama and Terma cycles as well as Lama Gongdü and the Rinchen Terzod.

    At the request of his uncle Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche, Lama Drimed came
    to the U.S. in 2003 to teach Buddha Dharma to Western
    students.  In 2004, he founded the non-profit
    organization Shensem Tsogpa Tibetan Cultural Center (STTCC) in
    support of one of his most emphasized missions — life release.  In 2005,
    he founded Dechen Rang Dharma Center to
    teach Buddhist practitioners in the South Bay.

    Lama Drimed currently lives in Alameda, at Orgyen Dorje Den. In
    addition to leading pujas and giving Vajrayana teachings, Lama Drimed
    serves on the ODD Board of Directors and is principal in
    maintaining the viability and integrity of the center. His compassion and
    kind guidance is a great asset to ODD.
