<h3 class="title">Lama Drimed Lodro</h3>

<p>

Lama Drimed Lodro was born to a nomadic family full of many renowned practitioners and yogis such as the

Venerable Gyatrul Rinpoche and Khenpo Lobsang Chophel Rinpoche. At an early age Lama Drimed demonstrated

faith and passion towards Dharma and started to attend Chinese school at the age of seven.

When he was twelve,

he began to learn Tibetan from the highly accomplished Galo Rinpoche and mastered the language without

difficulty.  During his time with Galo Rinpoche, Lama Drimed made great progress in learning both Dharma

and Tibetan.

Lama Drimed entered the renowned Sertha Larung Five Sciences Buddhist Academy at the age of 15.

He accepted ordination at the feet of HH Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche

and received major oral transmissions, pith instructions, and empowerments within the

Nyingma lineage, especially the Great Perfection empowerment and many precious

terma from Kyabje Jigphun Rinpoche.

Under his uncle Khenpo Lobsang Chophel Rinpoche’s rigorous training,

Lama Drimed has finished all the required courses for the qualification of a Khenpo degree.

The curriculum includes the main texts from the sutra, vinaya (the monastic discipline),

and treatises within Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana tradition.

Being proficient in Chinese, Lama Drimed has traveled around China to give teachings

at the request of H.H. Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche. After completing his degree, he traveled

to India to receive more teachings from H.H. Penor Rinpoche; there he received precious

empowerments of the Longchen Nyingthig and Palyul lineages from His Holiness.

Lama Drimed came to the States in 2003 hoping to spread the Dharma to the West

and benefit beings all over the world. He currently resides in the East Bay of California,

and is rapidly learning English. He gives regular teachings in Tibetan and Chinese at

Orgyen Dorje Den and at Dechen Rang in San Jose.
